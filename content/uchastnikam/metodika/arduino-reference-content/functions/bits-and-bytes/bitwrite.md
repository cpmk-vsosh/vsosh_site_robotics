**Description**

Writes to a bit of a variable, e.g. `bool`, `int`, `long`. Note that `float` & `double` are not supported. You can write to a bit of variables up to an `unsigned long` (32 bits / 4 bytes).

**Syntax**

`bitWrite(x, n, b)`

**Parameters**

`x`: the numeric variable to which to write.\
`n`: which bit of the number to write, starting at 0 for the least-significant (rightmost) bit.\
`b`: the value to write to the bit (0 or 1).

**Returns**

Nothing

**Example Code**

Demonstrates the use of bitWrite by printing the value of a variable to the Serial Monitor before and after the use of `bitWrite()`.

``` arduino
void setup() {
  Serial.begin(9600);
  while (!Serial) {}  // wait for serial port to connect. Needed for native USB port only
  byte x = 0b10000000;  // the 0b prefix indicates a binary constant
  Serial.println(x, BIN); // 10000000
  bitWrite(x, 0, 1);  // write 1 to the least significant bit of x
  Serial.println(x, BIN); // 10000001
}

void loop() {}
```
