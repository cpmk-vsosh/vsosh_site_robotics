**Description**

Integer constants are numbers that are used directly in a sketch, like 123. By default, these numbers are treated as [int](../../data-types/int) but you can change this with the U and L modifiers (see below).

Normally, integer constants are treated as base 10 (decimal) integers, but special notation (formatters) may be used to enter numbers in other bases.

| Base             | Example   | Formatter    | Comment                        |
|------------------|-----------|--------------|--------------------------------|
| 10 (decimal)     | 123       | none         |                                |
| 2 (binary)       | 0b1111011 | leading "0b" | characters 0&1 valid           |
| 8 (octal)        | 0173      | leading "0"  | characters 0-7 valid           |
| 16 (hexadecimal) | 0x7B      | leading "0x" | characters 0-9, A-F, a-f valid |

**Decimal (base 10)**

This is the common-sense math with which you are acquainted. Constants without other prefixes are assumed to be in decimal format.

**Example Code:**

``` arduino
n = 101;  // same as 101 decimal ((1 * 10^2) + (0 * 10^1) + 1)
```

**Binary (base 2)**

Only the characters 0 and 1 are valid.

**Example Code:**

``` arduino
n = 0b101; // same as 5 decimal ((1 * 2^2) + (0 * 2^1) + 1)
```

**Octal (base 8)**

Only the characters 0 through 7 are valid. Octal values are indicated by the prefix "0" (zero).

**Example Code:**

``` arduino
n = 0101; // same as 65 decimal ((1 * 8^2) + (0 * 8^1) + 1)
```

It is possible to generate a hard-to-find bug by (unintentionally) including a leading zero before a constant and having the compiler unintentionally interpret your constant as octal.

**Hexadecimal (base 16)**

Valid characters are 0 through 9 and letters A through F; A has the value 10, B is 11, up to F, which is 15. Hex values are indicated by the prefix "0x". Note that A-F may be upper (A-F) or lower case (a-f).

**Example Code:**

``` arduino
n = 0x101;  // same as 257 decimal ((1 * 16^2) + (0 * 16^1) + 1)
```

**Notes and Warnings**

**U & L formatters:**

By default, an integer constant is treated as an int with the attendant limitations in values. To specify an integer constant with another data type, follow it with:

- a 'u' or 'U' to force the constant into an unsigned data format. Example: 33u

- a 'l' or 'L' to force the constant into a long data format. Example: 100000L

- a 'ul' or 'UL' to force the constant into an unsigned long constant. Example: 32767ul
