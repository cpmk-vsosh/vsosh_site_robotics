**Description**

A data type used to store a character value. Character literals are written in single quotes, like this: 'A' (for multiple characters - strings - use double quotes: "ABC").

Characters are stored as numbers however. You can see the specific encoding in the [ASCII chart](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Reference/ASCIIchart). This means that it is possible to do arithmetic on characters, in which the ASCII value of the character is used (e.g. 'A' + 1 has the value 66, since the ASCII value of the capital letter A is 65). See `Serial.println` reference for more on how characters are translated to numbers.

The size of the `char` datatype is at least 8 bits. It’s recommended to only use `char` for storing characters. For an unsigned, one-byte (8 bit) data type, use the `byte` data type.

**Syntax**

`char var = val;`

**Parameters**

`var`: variable name.\
`val`: the value to assign to that variable.

**Example Code**

``` arduino
char myChar = 'A';
char myChar = 65; // both are equivalent
```
